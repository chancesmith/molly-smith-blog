The Smith household is experiencing growing pains! Okay, at this point it is more like experiencing morning sickness, but nevertheless, we are going to be blessed. Very blessed. Our plan said "no baby for at least 3 more years". However, God had a different plan and we are okay with that. I am just about 9 weeks pregnant, which means our baby should arrive around July 7, 2013!

I wanted to find the perfect way to tell Chance that we were going to have a baby. I don't know if this was the perfect way, but it was pretty cute. Being Dave Ramsey fans, we are very big on saving. So I bought the cutest little Precious Moments piggy bank and put a note on the top that read, "Our Baby's College Fund. Only 18 years and 9 months to save!" And I guess you could say he was <em>very</em> surprised. So surprised he didn't sleep for weeks. We were both more petrified than we were excited. But yesterday, our feelings changed.

Yesterday, we saw our sweet baby. We didn't just see him/her, we heard the heart beat. The very strong heartbeat! While there is still fear, we were both overcome with excitement at that sweet moment. I cannot even comprehend what it will be like to hold that baby in our arms. We ask for your prayers as we continue on this incredible journey.
