<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-292" title="family bible study" src="http://mollysmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/family-bible-study-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />Praying is one of the easiest ways to incorporate Scripture into your family's lifestyle. When you pray scripture with your kids, they will not only be learning the Word of God, but they will also be learning how applicable it is in every situation. Using scripture when  praying will also help you as a parent grow in your knowledge of the Holy Word of God. And parents, it is okay if you don't have the scriptures memorized. Nothing bad could come from your child seeing his or her parent with their Bible open praying scripture out loud. I have provided some example verses. I pray they will help as you take on the Biblical responsibility of drawing your family closer to the Lord Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1.Use a scripture passage of <em>thankfulness</em> in the mornings before breakfast.</strong>
"Oh give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, his steadfast love endures forever." Psalm 107:1
"Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His name."  Psalm 100:4
"This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." Psalm 118:24</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Stick a note in your kid's (or spouse's!) lunch box with a scripture of <em>encouragement</em>.</strong>
"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you." Deuteronomy 31:6
"No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it." 1 Corinthians 10:13
"Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken." Psalm 55:22</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3.Ask the Lord for <em>guidance </em>when praying as a family at the dinner table. </strong>
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight." Proverbs 3:5-6
“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you …” Mathew 7:7
"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." Psalm 119:105</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Pray a scripture of <em>protection</em> over each of your children (and your spouse!) before they go to sleep.</strong>
"But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one." 2 Thessalonians 3:3
"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Luke 12:32
"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." Psalm 46:1
