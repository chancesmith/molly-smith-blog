**I *totally* love incorporating literature into my preschool and elementary music classroom.** Therefore, the more I became familiar with the litary work of music educator Sharon Burch, the more I knew I wanted Freddie the Frog in my classroom! 

I met Sharon at Tennessee Music Educator's Association annual confrence when I was in college. I attended her session where she was going through her book [*Freddie the Frog and the Flying Jazz Kitten*](http://amzn.to/1qbk3v7). It was a blast!  I am entering my second year of teaching and now have more understanding how budgets work and how my classes run. So, I just had plan on introducing my kids to Freddie and his first adventure, Freddie the [*Frog and the Thump in the Night, First Adventure: Treble Clef Island*](http://amzn.to/1mc5sHD). The book comes with an enclosed CD that has full narration and 2 sing along songs. I ordered the [Freddie the Frog Puppet](http://amzn.to/WdMOKN) too, because why not?  #funstuff
