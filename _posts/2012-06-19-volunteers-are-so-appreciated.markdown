<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> For any children's ministry to be successful, it  needs volunteers . . . and lots of them! I have only been at First Baptist Henderson for a few weeks now and already I have been on my knees thanking God for the parent volunteers he has placed in this ministry. It is this fine group of people that kept the Children's Ministry afloat until they found a Children's Director and between the time that I was voted on and able to start full-time. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For this reason, the Children's Ministry of First Baptist Church Henderson would like to invite all volunteers in Children's Sunday School, Children's Church, Team Kid, Children's Choir, Vacation Bible School, and Nursery to an <i>Appreciation Dessert Night. </i>It will take place on Monday night July 2 at 7PM in the CLC. Bring nothing but yourself! All desserts will be provided for you as a small token of our deep appreciation for you. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Please RSVP by calling me at 731-989-2626, emailing me at mollysmith52811@gmail.com, or commenting below. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Blessings to you. </span>
