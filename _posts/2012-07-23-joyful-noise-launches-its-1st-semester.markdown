As some of you know, I have taught piano and voice lessons for 4 years through Englewood Baptist Church. Since my career has moved my husband and I to Henderson,TN  I have been toying with exactly what to do with music lessons. I have decided that I simply cannot give up teaching those sweet fingers how to play the piano and those voices how to sing. This is why I am launching my own personal music studio entitled, "Joyful Noise!" Psalm 98:4 says, "Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music." I pray that the truth in title of this studio, the studio verse, and the studio mission statement may be fulfilled in each and every lesson.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Joyful Noise Mission Statement:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The mission of Joyful Noise is to lovingly instruct young students the art of excellence in music. It is designed to teach each student how to experience self-discipline through the act of both piano and vocal instruction, practice, and performance. Piano literature will be selected to increase the student's ability to play on the piano, knowledge of music theory (as pertains to the student's level of skill), and performance ability. Vocal exercises and literature will be selected to increase the student's ability to create supported, clear, and appropriate vocal production.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first semester of Joyful Noise will begin the week of August 13. Lessons times are flexible to fit with the busy schedule families possess. See the Joyful Noise page at the top of this website to register your student, for payment information, and to place orders for music instruction literature. For more information, please feel free to contact me via my contact page.</p>
