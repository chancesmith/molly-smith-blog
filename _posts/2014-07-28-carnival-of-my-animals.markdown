No one can expect a group of 20 3-4 year olds to sit still for a 20 minute music class. Nor should they! My music classes are about fun with music. Love me or leave me, that's just how we roll. 

When I was scanning books on amazon that I could use in my class this year, I came across [*Carnival of the Animals*](http://amzn.to/U5J0cm) by Jack Prelutsky. I am SO excited. This book plays through the musical suite Carnival of the Animals by Saint-SaÃ«ns'. I love the way it is presented. There is a short poem about each animal with a beautiful illustrated picture on the opposing page. The book comes with a narrated CD that has the suite recording built into the narration. So, this is how it will play out in my classroom: 

 **Play CD.**

  **Listen to each animal poem.**

 **After each poem, move around the room acting like the animal presented while the corresponding musical selection is played.** 

FUN + CLASSICAL MUSIC + MOVEMENT = BEST TEACHER EVER!
