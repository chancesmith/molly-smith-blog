In school, we all learned best when we had an understanding of "why" or "how" what was being taught directly influenced our lives. We are all guilty of using the expression, "I will never use this" while in Pre-Calculus or Chemistry. So, why then, do parents and teachers respond to children with "...Because I said so" when requesting obedience? They want practical application just like we do.

Don't misunderstand, I am a HUGE advocate for "first time obedience." I believe far too many parents let their children get by with repeat offenses. What I want to purpose is that instead of fighting the fight, explain to your children a Biblical truth each time a feud arises. This will turn your "Because I said so" into "Because God says so." God is perfect at what He does, and I am less than perfect at what I do, so I personally would rather pass it on up!

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are some key verses for correcting your children: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When they really don't want to brush their teeth:</em>
"Do everything without complaining or arguing." - Philippians 2:14</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When saying "no" to their BFF spending the night on a school night:</em>
"Honor your father and mother."- Matthew 19:19</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When fighting over the favorite video game controller:</em>
"Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves." - Romans 12:10</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you find the toys stuffed under the bed, instead of put up where they belong:</em>
"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." - Ephesians 6:1</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you hear what sounds like a smack down coming from upstairs:</em>
"I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me."- Matthew 25:40</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And always remind them that we do not disobey because we love God:</em>
"Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength."- Deuteronomy 6:5</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>May the Force be with you!</strong></em></p>
