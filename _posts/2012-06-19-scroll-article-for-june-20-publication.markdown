<b style="font-weight: normal;"></b><br /><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Psalm 119:105 says, “Your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.” As adults, we know this to be true because we have relied on it’s truth during many hard and trying times. But our kids are just starting out in their Christian walk and need to be taught how to rely on God’s word in every situation. It is the responsibility of the parents to instill this belief in their children and it is the church’s job to reinforce it every chance they get. Encourage your kids to memorize Psalm 119:105 this week. They will be forever blessed by having this word in their heart.</span></b></div>
