The ladies of FBC Henderson are getting together every Sunday night to learn amazing lessons and experience lots of laughter! We are studying Lysa Terkeurst's <em>Made to Crave. </em>All I can say is "WOW!" This study is phenomenal. It is so eye opening how Christians view being over weight as something acceptable when it is not! Is it extremely hard to get away from eating food that is harmful to your body? Yes! Is sin ever an easy cycle to break? No! We are learning how we were made to crave something . . . and that something is God. Lysa's book is packed with scriptures to help you combat temptation and make you feel empowered.

If you are a Jesus girl and want to experience true freedom both spiritually and physically, check out this book! It will chance your life!
