to Ghost","slug":"welcome-to-ghost","markdown":"You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing.

We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started</h2>\n\n<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>\n\n<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Item number one</li>\n<li>Item number two\n<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>\n<li>A final item</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or with numbers!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>\n<li>Drink the milk  </li>\n<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"links\">Links</h3>\n\n<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whataboutimages\">What about Images?</h3>\n\n<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png\" alt=\"The Ghost Logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too.

We have listened to Dave Ramsey speak on it in his book <em>EntreLeadership</em> and we caught his passion for how destructive gossip can be. He and I have set a rule in our home that if one of us begins to gossip, we have the responsibility to stop the other one. We will call each other out if we even feel like our conversation is heading in that direction. </span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n</span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A few years ago the Lord spoke to me and I felt it down to the core of my being. He said to me, \"Girl, you want me to use you? Then you better get a hold of your mouth!\" He has brought that truth back to me over the past few years. I have experienced embarrassing and uncomfortable situations simply because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. I have seen and experienced the destruction of gossip for both the gossip-er and the gossip-ie. </span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n</span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I believe that the devil knows exactly how to tempt and destroy the church. Most of us are not tempted to experiment with drugs, we have no desire commit a murder or mess around in the area of serious alcohol addiction. However, he KNOWS we are easy to get on the gossip-train and ride it day in and day out. I mean, come on, you know that lady had a crazy outfit on Sunday. And did you SEE the way that he spoke to his wife?  My kid came home and told me that her kid plays video games 7 hours a day. Can you believe a parent would let her child do that? That would never happen in our house. </span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n</span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">You see how easy it is? It is so easy, I was convicted by merely typing the examples. In the very short time I have held a particular position of leadership, gossip has already come around to hurt my soul and effect my worship. Luke 16:10 says, <span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"><em>\"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.\"</em> How then can we expect God to bless our families, ministries, personal lives, place of business, classroom, if we can not learn to keep our mouths shut. If we talk about other teachers, workers, or peers, behind their backs how can we ever expect God to give us more friends, more students to minister to, or more good opportunities. We have to be faithful with what he has given us. Gossip is a prime example of how to destroy the church's faithfulness to Christ. </span></span>\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n</span></span>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"> Dave Ramsey says, \"Negatives go up; Positives go around.\" To put it simply, if there is an issue, take it to someone who can take care of the problem. If there is something positive to say such as, \"I was really impressed with how she handled all 20 kids by herself Sunday morning,\" tell it to whoever you want! </span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\">In the Children's Ministry at First Baptist Church, I am striving to have an<em> Open-Door Policy</em>. This means that any time there is a situation within the ministry that is problematic, whether that be a teacher not appropriately teaching the lesson, a child who is causing serious issues, or you feel that I personally am not fulfilling my responsibilities, my door is open. I am in the office every week and my cell phone is always available for a phone call. Our talks are and will be completely confidential.

We have listened to Dave Ramsey speak on it in his book <em>EntreLeadership</em> and we caught his passion for how destructive gossip can be. He and I have set a rule in our home that if one of us begins to gossip, we have the responsibility to stop the other one. We will call each other out if we even feel like our conversation is heading in that direction. </span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <br />\n</span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A few years ago the Lord spoke to me and I felt it down to the core of my being. He said to me, \"Girl, you want me to use you? Then you better get a hold of your mouth!\" He has brought that truth back to me over the past few years. I have experienced embarrassing and uncomfortable situations simply because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. I have seen and experienced the destruction of gossip for both the gossip-er and the gossip-ie. </span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <br />\n</span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I believe that the devil knows exactly how to tempt and destroy the church. Most of us are not tempted to experiment with drugs, we have no desire commit a murder or mess around in the area of serious alcohol addiction. However, he KNOWS we are easy to get on the gossip-train and ride it day in and day out. I mean, come on, you know that lady had a crazy outfit on Sunday. And did you SEE the way that he spoke to his wife?  My kid came home and told me that her kid plays video games 7 hours a day. Can you believe a parent would let her child do that? That would never happen in our house. </span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <br />\n</span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">You see how easy it is? It is so easy, I was convicted by merely typing the examples. In the very short time I have held a particular position of leadership, gossip has already come around to hurt my soul and effect my worship. Luke 16:10 says, <span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"><em>\"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.\"</em> How then can we expect God to bless our families, ministries, personal lives, place of business, classroom, if we can not learn to keep our mouths shut. If we talk about other teachers, workers, or peers, behind their backs how can we ever expect God to give us more friends, more students to minister to, or more good opportunities. We have to be faithful with what he has given us. Gossip is a prime example of how to destroy the church's faithfulness to Christ. </span></span> <br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <br />\n</span></span> <br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\"> Dave Ramsey says, \"Negatives go up; Positives go around.\" To put it simply, if there is an issue, take it to someone who can take care of the problem. If there is something positive to say such as, \"I was really impressed with how she handled all 20 kids by herself Sunday morning,\" tell it to whoever you want! </span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;\">In the Children's Ministry at First Baptist Church, I am striving to have an<em> Open-Door Policy</em>. This means that any time there is a situation within the ministry that is problematic, whether that be a teacher not appropriately teaching the lesson, a child who is causing serious issues, or you feel that I personally am not fulfilling my responsibilities, my door is open.

We are studying Lysa Terkeurst's <em>Made to Crave. </em>All I can say is \"WOW!\" This study is phenomenal. It is so eye opening how Christians view being over weight as something acceptable when it is not! Is it extremely hard to get away from eating food that is harmful to your body? Yes!

In August we kicked off our new curriculum, \"The Gospel Project for Kids!\" and I LOVE this curriculum. And even more importantly, they kids love it too. We are working our way from Genesis to Revelation and connecting each story with the ultimate Story of Christ redeeming us!\r\n<a href=\"http://mollysmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-08-29-19.27.23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-247\" title=\"2012-08-29 19.27.23\" src=\"http://mollysmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-08-29-19.27.23-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" /></a>\r\n4. The last Wednesday in August we had 9 of our kids baptized! We went out to Chickasaw for a special baptismal service in the lake. When I suggested this, I had never been to Chickasaw and didn't know quite how brown the water was. Ick! I told the kids they were just getting the real \"Galilee experience.\" They seemed okay with that.\r\n\r\n5. September was not quite so filled up. We had See You At The Pole. Next year I am going to help in making the SYATP at our Middle School really great!\r\n\r\n6. October was CRAZY. The kids all had Fall Break for a week. Then we had a going-away party for one of my favorite 4th graders ever. Then we had an awesome \"Cotton Ride\" (its like a hayride, but you sit on piles of cotton instead). Then, on Halloween we had the church's annual \"Fall Festival.\" We had over 1000 people come through our church that <a href=\"http://mollysmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-10-21-16.07.15.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-248 alignleft\" title=\"2012-10-21 16.07.15\" src=\"http://mollysmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-10-21-16.07.15-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" /></a>night. The best part is that each of them were shown and told how much Jesus loves them. I have always been an anti-Halloween person and really struggled with the thought of \"celebrating\" Halloween. But, through a lot of prayer, I was shown that we were not \"celebrating\" Halloween, we were just using Halloween night as a way to make contact with  many families who need to be in church. After all, what could make the devil madder than using his holiday to tell people about Jesus and try to get them involved in a local church?! Church-1 Devil-0.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, Joyful Noise lessons are coming to a close next week with the recital on Nov. 16th. It has been a fun semester and I have really enjoyed getting to know my new students! I am looking forward to the holiday break, but will be accepting new students in January!

When you pray scripture with your kids, they will not only be learning the Word of God, but they will also be learning how applicable it is in every situation. Using scripture when  praying will also help you as a parent grow in your knowledge of the Holy Word of God. And parents, it is okay if you don't have the scriptures memorized.

So, this is how it will play out in my classroom: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Play CD.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Listen to each animal poem.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>After each poem, move around the room acting like the animal presented while the corresponding musical selection is played.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>FUN + CLASSICAL MUSIC + MOVEMENT = BEST TEACHER EVER!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/Carnival-of-the-Animals.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-07-15T00:02:44.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-07-28T13:20:37.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-07-28T13:20:37.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":37,"uuid":"8239ceb9-c06d-4889-b0a4-d654cd1d57fa","title":"You've been upgraded to the latest version of Ghost","slug":"ghost-0-7","markdown":"You've just upgraded to the latest version of Ghost and we've made a few changes that you should probably know about!\n\n## Woah, why does everything look different?\n\nAfter two years and hundreds of thousands of users, we learned a great deal about what was (and wasn't) working in the old Ghost admin user interface.
