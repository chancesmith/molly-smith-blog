title: 5th and 6th grade . . . How do I make them feel like they belong?
---

It doesn't take you long when working in Kid's Ministry that you discover that 5th and 6th grade students have a hard time finding out where they fit. The songs are too "kid-ish" and the lessons are "boring." They have a hard time finding where they fit and we as teachers have a hard time getting them excited about . . . well . . . anything.
<div></div>
<div>I have been struggling with this situation for some time now. I want so badly for the kid's in my ministry to feel connected, supported, and comfortable. I want every 5th and 6th grade student at First Baptist Church to know exactly where they belong. This is why I am launching <em>Girl Talk. </em>In <em>Girl Talk </em>I will meet with any 5th and 6th grade girl at the church to study what it means to be a Godly girl/pre-teen/woman. We will read and discuss the book by Elizabeth George, <em>A Young Woman's Walk With God. </em>I am hoping that through this we will all grow closer to each other, closer to God, and know exactly where we belong - in the arms of our Heavenly Father.</div>

<div>I am still in search for a good study for boys. If you have any recommendations, please comment on this post. There are about 500,000 options for pre-teen girls but 0 for pre-teen boys.  Please be in prayer for this decision and that the Lord will send the right leaders and the right kids!</div>
