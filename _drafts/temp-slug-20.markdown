We are very interested!!  She has had only a few weeks of Piano but that is all.. She is VERY interested in music!! She loves it! She is more leaning toward playing Conemporary Gospel rather then Southern Gospel.. we listen to mostly Gospel music... if you could get back with me I would appreciate it alot!  Thank You for your time
