title: Be still my beating heart!
---

My baby is not a baby anymore. Last week, he turned 1 and this week he had his first hair cut. Everyone told me that time would fly with a baby, but you don't understand it until you have one of your own. The last year was full of the adventure and fun. Chance and I love our little boy more than words can express. I mean, LOOK at this kid!
